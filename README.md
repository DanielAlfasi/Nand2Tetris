## Introduction

The NAND2Tetris course, also known as The Elements of Computing Systems, involves building a modern, fully functional computer system from first principles. The course covers all levels of computer abstractions, including hardware (Boolean gates, ALUs, memory systems, machine language), software (assembler, virtual machines), operating systems, and high-level languages.

## Projects

Here are the projects completed:

1. **Project 1:** Boolean Logic
2. **Project 2:** Boolean Arithmetic
3. **Project 3:** Sequential Logic
4. **Project 4:** Machine Language
5. **Project 5:** Computer Architecture
6. **Project 6:** Assembler
7. **Project 7:** VM I: Stack Arithmetic
8. **Project 8:** VM II: Program Control
9. **Project 9:** High-Level Language - Zombie shooting game
10. **Project 10:** Compiler I: Syntax Analysis
11. **Project 11:** Compiler II: Code Generation


## Installation

Before running these projects, ensure you have the required software installed:

1. NAND2Tetris software suite
2. Java 11 or newer (for running the hardware simulator)
3. A modern web browser (for accessing project materials)

## Usage

To run any of the projects, you need to load the relevant `.hdl`, `.asm`, `.vm`, or `.jack` file into the corresponding part of the NAND2Tetris software suite.

Please refer to the official NAND2Tetris guide for more detailed instructions: http://nand2tetris.org/
